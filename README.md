# Deep Learning-based Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for pneumonia classification using Chest X-ray images. It includes training a ResNet-18 model from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet-18 on ImageNet to classify pneumonia from X-ray images.

## Setting up the environment:
The code implemented on the Google Colab environment. On working with the notebook, please switch to any GPU available for better performance. Additionally, the .ipynb notebook file has been uploaded(refer to sections) for reproducibility.

## Code Usage:
### Using Google Colab
Check the .ipynb file, the google colab code link has shared. Click the link and directly run the cells to work with the task.

### Hosting the file locally
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/SucharithaVemuri07/Pneumonia_Detection.git
2. Open the Repository directory
   ```bash
   %cd Pneumonia_Detection
4. Navigate to the Detection_Model.ipynb file and run the cells sequentially
5. First and second cells are the necessary packages and libraries required to installed/setup
6. Addition step - On Step2, update the dataset file path location locally (dataset_mainpath)
