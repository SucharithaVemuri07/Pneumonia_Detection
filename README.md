# Deep Learning-based Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for pneumonia classification using Chest X-ray images. It includes training a ResNet-18 model from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet-18 on ImageNet to classify pneumonia from X-ray images.

## Setting up the environment:
The code implemented on Google Colab environment. On working with the notebook, please switch to any GPU available for better performance. Additionally, the .ipynb notebook file has been uploaded(refer sections) for reproducibility.

## Code Usage:
1. Clone the repository in Google Colab
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-classification.git
